      <h2 class="header2">The Culture</h2>
      <p>
        We strongly believe there's always an opportunity to learn from each
        other outside of day-to-day work, whether it's company-wide offsites,
        internal hackathons, or co-worker meetups. We always value cross-team
        collaboration and diversity of thought, no matter the job title.
      </p>
      <h2 class="header2">The People</h2>
      <p>
        We're all passionate about building a more efficient and inclusive
        financial infrastructure together. At PayAPI, we have diverse
        backgrounds and skills.
